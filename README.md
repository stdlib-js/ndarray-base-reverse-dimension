    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import reverseDimension from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-base-reverse-dimension@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### reverseDimension( x, dim, writable )

Returns a view of an input ndarray in which the order of elements along a specified dimension is reversed.

```javascript
import ndarray from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-ctor@esm/index.mjs';
import ndarray2array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-to-array@esm/index.mjs';

var buffer = [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 ];
var shape = [ 3, 2 ];
var strides = [ 2, 1 ];
var offset = 0;

var x = ndarray( 'generic', buffer, shape, strides, offset, 'row-major' );
// returns <ndarray>

var sh = x.shape;
// returns [ 3, 2 ]

var arr = ndarray2array( x );
// returns [ [ 1.0, 2.0 ], [ 3.0, 4.0 ], [ 5.0, 6.0 ] ]

var y = reverseDimension( x, 0, false );
// returns <ndarray>

sh = y.shape;
// returns [ 3, 2 ]

arr = ndarray2array( y );
// returns [ [ 5.0, 6.0 ], [ 3.0, 4.0 ], [ 1.0, 2.0 ] ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **x**: input ndarray.
-   **dim**: index of dimension along which to reverse elements. If provided an integer less than zero, the dimension index is resolved relative to the last dimension, with the last dimension corresponding to the value `-1`.
-   **writable**: boolean indicating whether a returned ndarray should be writable.
